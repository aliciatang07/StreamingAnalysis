## Tech Stack 
Kafka for streaming data processing <br/>
MongoDB for database <br/>
Spark for map reduce computation<br/>
web frame(last part)<br/>
realtime api for feeding streaming data <br/>
django for backend server <br/>


possible: kubernetes, docker <br/>


## basic idea:
1. music recommendation system(based on categorization, author, style) <br/>
2. a generalization recommendation tool(client can feed own data and recommendation algorithm)ex: api <br/>
3. good extension opportunity for further expansion 
4.tryout different ML model for recommendation system 
5.backend side: user type their favoriate music and provide their
music listening preference


## basic architecture
separate data processing part, that part provide separate api 
so backend can call on it and has its own logic 



## env setup 
local setup <br/>
aws/azure setup <br/>


## practice goal 
streaming process, big data  <br/>
distributed system <br/>
cloud computing <br/>
concurrency? parallel <br/>


## focus resut
system performance <br/>
prediction result(accuracy)<br/>
